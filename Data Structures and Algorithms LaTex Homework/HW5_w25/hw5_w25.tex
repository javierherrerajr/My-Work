\begin{problem}
Determine whether the two graphs below are planar or not.
To show planarity, give a planar embedding.
To show that a graph is not planar, use Kuratowski's theorem.

{\large Graph $H$:\ }

{\large Graph $G$:\ }
\begin{minipage}{2.1in}

\begin{minipage}{2.4in}

\end{center}

\vspace{0.1in} - Graph $G$ is planar. The planar embedding is shown above.

\vspace{0.1in} - Graph $H$ is not planar. It contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of $K_{5}$, which is a non-planar graph. Therefore, by Kuratowski's theorem, $H$ is not planar.

\begin{problem}
	You are given two bipartite graphs $G$ and $H$ below. For each
	graph determine whether it has a perfect matching.
	Justify your answer, either by 
	listing the edges that are in the matching or using
	Hall's Theorem to show that the graph does not have a
	perfect matching.

\vspace{0.1in} - Graph $G$ does not have a perfect matching. By Hall's Theorem, there is no perfect matching in $H$ because the number of neighbors of $X$ is less than $|X|$ for the set $X = \{a, b, c, d,e,f\}$.

\vspace{0.1in} - Graph $H$ has a perfect matching. The perfect matching is $\{(c,0), (a, 1), (b, 2), (e, 3), (d, 4), (f,5)\}$.

(a) For each degree sequence below, determine whether there is a graph with $6$ vertices where vertices have
these degrees. If a graph exists,  (i) draw it, (ii) find the chromatic number and justify, (iii) determine whether the graph has an Euler tour and justify, (iv) determine whether the graph has a Hamiltonian cycle and justify. If no such graph exists, justify.

\paragraph{Academic integrity declaration.}
The homework papers must include at the end an academic integrity declaration. This should be a short paragraph where you briefly explain 
\emph{in your own words}  (1) whether you did the homework individually or in collaboration with a partner student (if so, provide the name), 
and (2) whether you used any external help or resources. 

\vspace{0.1in} - For all the problems above, I referenced all the examples shown in the planar and bipartite graph lecture notes and slides. I 
also used 2 youtube videos to better understand the concepts of planar graphs and bipartite graphs. I did this homework individually.

\paragraph{Submission.}
To submit the homework, you need to upload the pdf file to Gradescope. If you submit with a partner, you need
to put two names on the assignment and submit it as a group assignment.
Remember that only {\LaTeX} papers are accepted.
